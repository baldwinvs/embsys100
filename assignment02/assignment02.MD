# Assignment 02

#### 1. Inject 0x1FFFFFFF for the "counter" value in the variable window, then step thru the program only once to increment "counter".

###### a) What is the value of the "counter" from the "Locals" window?

<stuff>

###### b) What is the value of the "counter" in the "Register" window?

<stuff>

###### c) Which flags are set in the APSR register? Explain why?

<stuff>

#### 2. If you write all Fs (0xFFFFFFFF) in the Register value for "counter" then step step thru the pgoram once to increment "counter"

###### a) What happens to the value of "counter" in the "Locals" window?

<stuff>

###### b) What flags, if any, are set in the APSR?

<stuff>

#### 3. Change the "counter" variable type in your code to "unsigned". Inject the value "**0x1FFFFFFF**" then step thru the program to increment the "counter" once:

###### a) What is the value of "counter" in the "Locals" window after incrementing for each value?

<stuff>

###### b) What flags, if any, are set in the APSR?  Explain why.

<stuff>

#### 4. Change the "counter" variable type in your code to "unsigned". Inject the value "**0xFFFFFFFF**" then step thru the program to increment the "counter" once:

###### a) What is the value of "counter" in the "Locals" window after incrementing for each value?

<stuff>

###### b) What flags, if any, are set in the APSR? Explain why.

<stuff>

#### 5. Move the "counter" variable outside of main (at the top of the file):

###### a) What is the scope of the variable "counter"?

<stuff>

###### b) Is it still visible in the "Locals" view?

<stuff>

###### c) In which window view can we track "counter" now?

<stuff>

###### d) What is the address of the "counter" variable in memory?

<stuff>

#### 6. Change the source code as described in Assignment_02.pdf, then run the program in the simulator:

###### a) What is the value of "counter" at the end of the program (halting at the **return 0** statement)?

<stuff>

###### b) Explain why the counter value has changed.

<stuff>

#### 7. Change the setting of IAR to run the same program on the **evaluation board**.

###### a) What is the address where "counter" is stored?

<stuff>

###### b) Is the "counter" variable stored in RAM or ROM?

<stuff>

###### c) What is the value of "counter" at the end of the program (halting at the **return 0** statement)?

<stuff>
