# Assignment 03

### 1. Morse Code is considered a sequence of binaries. Please read about Morse Code and share the following findings:

##### a. What is Morse Code?

"<b>Morse code</b> is a character encoding scheme used in telecommunications that encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations called *dots* and *dashes*."<sup>[1]</sup>

##### b. Who developed Morse Code?

<b>Samuel Morse</b> developed the numerals in Morse Code which was later expanded by <b>Alfred Vail</b> to include letters and special characters so that Morse Code could be used more generally.<sup>[1]</sup>

### 2. Using the Internation Morse Code, write a small program to present your <b>first name</b> using the user LED on the Nucleo-F401RE evaluation board.

### 3. Using the STM32CubeMX tool: generate boiler plate code for controlling the LED and implement a simple blinking LED program using the code generated.

*Note: I've just used my code from the Morse Code problem here.*
